        I like Arnold Schwarzenegger and here are some interesting facts about
        him: <br /><br />Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947) is an
        Austrian and American actor, businessman, filmmaker, retired
        professional bodybuilder, and politician who served as the 38th governor
        of California between 2003 and 2011. Time magazine named Schwarzenegger
        one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and 2007.

        Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win
        the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and subsequently won the Mr. Olympia
        title seven times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest
        bodybuilders of all time, and has written many books and articles about
        bodybuilding. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most
        important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He
        appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977).
        Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding and gained worldwide fame as a
        Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery
        epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984.
        After playing the title character in the science fiction film The
        Terminator (1984), he starred in the sequels Terminator 2: Judgment Day
        (1991), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Genisys
        (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). His other successful action
        films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987),
        Red Heat (1988), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition
        to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), Junior
        (1994), and Jingle All the Way (1996). He is the founder of the film
        production company Oak Productions.

        As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October
        7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray
        Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat
        runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the
        remainder of Davis' term, and was re-elected in the 2006 California
        gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a
        full term as governor. In 2011, he reached his term limit as governor
        and returned to acting.
